# Udpate (second raport - 17.04.2023)

What's new?
====

 - main.py it's now main file of all project, it has "Player" and "Object" classes
 - code is cleaner, more readable, the gravity mechanism is improved
 - I created my own spritesheets (inspired by work found in internet)
    to get animations of walking (e.g. Han Solo character)

TODO
====

 - create the rest of characters and their spritesheets to get animations no
    only for walking, but also shooting, using lightsabers and jumping
