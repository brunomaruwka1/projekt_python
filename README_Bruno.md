# STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE GAME

My project is going to be a simple rpg game based on story from the movie
"Star Wars: A New Hope". It will consist of approximately 10 levels in which
the player will have to face opponents.

INSTALLATION
===
- you need to install pygame library at your device:
    1. Open the command prompt/terminal on your computer.
    2. Type the following command: 
    
    ```
    pip install
    ```
    pygame and hit Enter.  
    This command will download and install Pygame along with its dependencies.
    
    Note: If you're using Python 3, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip.

TODO
====

- create all images of characters
- create characters animations (e.g. running, jumping, using ligthsaber)
- write code responsible for the combat mechanics
- add movie soundtrack 
- add 1 vs 1 mode, in which 2 players, could face each other offline
