# STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE GAME

My project is going to be a simple rpg game based on story from the movie
"Star Wars: A New Hope". It will consist of approximately 10 levels in which
the player will have to face opponents.

INSTALLATION
===
- you need to install pygame library at your device:
    1. Open the command prompt/terminal on your computer.
    2. Type the following command: 
    
    ```
    pip install
    ```
    pygame and hit Enter.  
    This command will download and install Pygame along with its dependencies.
    
    Note: If you're using Python 3, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip.

What's new?
====

 - main.py it's now main file of all project, it has "Player" and "Object" classes
 - code is cleaner, more readable, the gravity mechanism is improved
 - I created my own spritesheets (inspired by work found in internet)
    to get animations of walking (e.g. Han Solo character)

TODO

 - create the rest of characters and their spritesheets to get animations no
    only for walking, but also shooting, using lightsabers and jumping
